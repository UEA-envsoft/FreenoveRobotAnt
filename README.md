# FreenoveRobotAnt

Useful files for the Freenove Robot Ant

sepression.STL and ultasonic.STL are origional head designs, kindly supplied by Freenove

frankenhead.STL is a head allowing for combiining the ultrasoni sensor and the led dot matrix

ant_leg.STL is the STL file for a leg section, also from Freenove (after I dropped my ant and broke his leg)!
